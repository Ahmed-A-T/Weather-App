## How It Works
1. Enter a City Name: The user inputs the name of a city into the search bar.
2. Fetch Weather Data: A request is sent to the weather API to fetch real-time weather information for the specified city.
3. Display Weather Details: The weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) is displayed on the screen for the user to view.
